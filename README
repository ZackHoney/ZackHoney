I have 10 years of construction experience where I excelled at solving real time problems with projects. 
I have always had an interest in the Tech Industry and finally decided to enroll in Bloomtech so I can learn and get into the field I have always wanted to be in!
While at Bloomtech, I have learned how to do so many things that I never thought I could do. I can now look at pages and lines of code and I can decipher what it all means and what it is doing. 
I have knowledge of Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, SQLite3, and much more. I am confident in my ability to learn other new languages and be able to excel after a short amount of time.
